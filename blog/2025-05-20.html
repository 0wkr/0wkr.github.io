  <h1>🌄 Daily Blog – May 20, 2025</h1>
  <p><i>Today’s mood: Reflective</i></p>

  <p>Today I started building my personal blog hosted on GitHub Pages. The goal is to write one post per day, document things I watch, read, or think about, and keep it all super minimal and raw.</p>

  <p>I added a <a href="/random/">Random Zone</a> where I can just dump logs or rants. This might become more fun than I thought.</p>

  <p>Hosting was easy — GitHub Pages + simple HTML. No fancy frameworks, no distractions.</p>
